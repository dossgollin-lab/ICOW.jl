Every model makes simplifying assumptions.
Understanding these assumptions is essential for interpreting results and knowing when iCOW is the right tool for your analysis.

## Key Idealizations

### Wedge Geometry

The city is represented as a uniform wedge that rises linearly from sea level to elevation $H_{\text{city}}$.
Real coastal cities have irregular topography, varying building density, and heterogeneous land use.
The wedge captures the first-order effect -- higher surges flood more area at greater depth -- but misses localized features like low-lying inland areas or elevated ridges.

**Implication**: iCOW is best suited for comparative analysis ("Strategy A vs. Strategy B") rather than absolute damage estimation for a specific real city.

### Homogeneous Building Stock

All buildings are treated identically within each zone, with uniform height ($H_{\text{bldg}}$) and value density.
Real cities have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings with different vulnerability functions [@demoel_reducing:2014].

**Implication**: The model captures portfolio-level tradeoffs but not building-level targeting of interventions.

### Static Decisions

The `StaticPolicy` makes all investment decisions at the start of the planning horizon and maintains them throughout.
Real flood risk management involves sequential decisions over time -- building a seawall now, potentially elevating buildings later, possibly retreating if conditions worsen [@garner_slrise:2018].

**Implication**: Results reflect the value of a fixed strategy.
Adaptive policies (which respond to observed conditions) may perform better.
The SimOptDecisions framework supports adaptive policies, but ICOW.jl currently implements only static ones.

### Stationary Hazard (EAD Mode)

The GEV distribution in `EADScenario` is stationary -- the surge distribution does not change over time.
In reality, sea level rise and changing storm patterns make flood hazards nonstationary.

**Implication**: To study nonstationarity, you can compare results across scenarios with different GEV parameters (as in the [Tutorial](tutorial.qmd)).
The Stochastic mode accepts arbitrary time series, which can encode nonstationary hazards.

### No Spatial Correlation

Each year's storm is independent.
The model does not capture multi-year clustering of storms or compound events (e.g., a storm surge coinciding with heavy rainfall).

**Implication**: Damage estimates may underestimate risk from correlated extremes.

### Simplified Damage Function

Damage is a linear function of flood depth within each zone, capped at the zone's full value.
Real depth-damage functions are nonlinear and uncertain, with considerable variability across building types [@zarekarizi_suboptimal:2020].

**Implication**: The model's damage estimates are useful for comparing strategies but should not be interpreted as precise dollar amounts.

## What's Included

- Three interacting defense strategies (withdrawal, resistance, dikes)
- Five elevation zones with different damage behavior
- Nonlinear cost structures for each strategy type
- Dike failure probability that increases with overtopping
- Catastrophic damage amplification above a threshold
- Discounted present-value accounting
- Two simulation modes (expected value and stochastic)

## What's Excluded

- Sea level rise (handled externally via scenario design)
- Spatially varying topography or land use
- Building-level heterogeneity
- Construction timing or phasing of investments
- Indirect economic losses (business interruption, displacement)
- Correlated or compound hazards
- Equity and distributional impacts across populations
- Ecological or environmental co-benefits of strategies

## When to Use iCOW

iCOW is well-suited for:

- **Comparing strategy portfolios**: Understanding how combinations of withdrawal, resistance, and dikes perform relative to individual strategies
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Exploring how outcomes change with hazard parameters, discount rates, or city characteristics
- **Teaching and research**: Providing a transparent, fast model for studying flood risk decision making
- **Screening**: Quickly identifying promising strategy combinations before detailed regional modeling

## When You Need Something Else

Consider a different tool when:

- You need **building-level damage estimates** for a specific real city
- You need to model **spatially heterogeneous** topography or land use
- You need to capture **dynamic adaptation** (sequential decisions over time with learning)
- You need **hydrodynamic simulation** of flood routing and inundation patterns
- You need to model **compound hazards** (surge + rainfall + river flooding)

::: {.callout-note}
The goal of an intermediate-complexity model is not to replace detailed regional analysis, but to enable the kind of broad exploratory analysis that detailed models make computationally infeasible.
Use iCOW to understand the decision landscape, then use detailed models to refine specific strategies of interest.

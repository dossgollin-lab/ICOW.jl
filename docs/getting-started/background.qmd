## The Problem

Coastal cities concentrate people, infrastructure, and economic value at low elevations where storm surges cause the most damage.
Managing this risk requires choosing among multiple protection strategies -- and making those choices before the storms arrive.

This is fundamentally a decision problem under uncertainty: how much should a city invest in flood protection, and what combination of strategies should it use?
The answer depends on uncertain future hazards, the costs of different interventions, and the city's tolerance for residual risk [@keller_management:2021; @doss-gollin_subjective:2023].

## Strategies for Coastal Flood Protection

Real-world coastal cities use three broad categories of protection, often in combination:

### Withdrawal (Managed Retreat)

Relocating people and assets away from the lowest-lying areas.
In practice this looks like:

- Buyout programs that purchase flood-prone properties
- Zoning changes that prevent new construction in high-risk areas
- Relocating critical infrastructure (hospitals, power stations) to higher ground

In iCOW, withdrawal is parameterized as a height $W$: everything below elevation $W$ is vacated.
The cost increases nonlinearly because the last buildings to relocate are the most expensive -- they sit on increasingly scarce remaining land.

### Resistance (Flood-Proofing)

Making buildings withstand flooding without structural failure.
In practice:

- Wet flood-proofing: allowing water to enter but using water-resistant materials
- Dry flood-proofing: sealing buildings to keep water out
- Elevating structures on stilts or raised foundations

In iCOW, resistance is parameterized by a height $R$ (how high up buildings are protected) and a fraction $P$ (what share of buildings are treated).
The cost increases sharply as $P$ approaches 1, reflecting the difficulty of retrofitting every building in a neighborhood.

### Dikes (Structural Barriers)

Building levees, seawalls, or storm surge barriers.
In practice:

- Earthen levees along riverbanks and coastlines
- Concrete floodwalls and storm surge barriers
- Moveable barriers (like the Maeslantkering in Rotterdam)

In iCOW, the dike is parameterized by a base height $B$ and a crest height $D$ above that base.
Dikes provide strong protection -- but when they fail, damage is amplified because residents and businesses behind the dike may not have prepared for flooding.

## Why Combinations Matter

No single strategy is optimal in all conditions.
Dikes provide strong average protection but create catastrophic risk if they fail.
Withdrawal is effective but expensive.
Resistance helps everywhere but doesn't stop flooding.
The key insight from @ceres_cityonawedge:2019 is that **portfolios of strategies** can outperform any individual strategy -- much like diversification in finance.

## The Modeling Gap

Researchers studying flood risk management face a tradeoff in model complexity:

**Simple analytical models** (e.g., @vandantzig_dike:1956) optimize a single strategy (typically dike height) against a single damage function.
They are fast and analytically tractable, but they miss the richness of strategy combinations and graduated damage.

**Regional simulation models** capture detailed topography, building-level damage, and hydrodynamic flooding.
They are realistic but computationally expensive, require extensive local data, and are difficult to embed in optimization or uncertainty analysis frameworks.

iCOW fills the gap between these extremes.
It captures the essential physics -- graduated damage that depends on flood depth, multiple interacting defense strategies, nonlinear cost structures -- while remaining fast enough to evaluate millions of strategy combinations.
This makes it suitable for the kinds of exploratory analysis and optimization that climate risk management demands.

## The Wedge Geometry

iCOW represents a coastal city as an **island on a wedge-shaped terrain** that rises from sea level to a maximum elevation $H_{\text{city}}$.
This is a stylized geometry inspired by areas like Lower Manhattan, where the terrain slopes upward from the waterfront.

The wedge captures a key physical reality: **higher surges cause more damage in two ways**.

1. **Larger flooded area** -- water reaches further inland on the slope
2. **Deeper flooding** -- buildings at low elevations experience greater water depth

These two effects create nonlinear damage relationships that simple binary (flood/no-flood) models miss.
The wedge approximation applies to any coastal city where terrain rises from the waterfront, which includes many real coastal settings.

The defense strategies divide the city's cross-section into five **zones** with different damage characteristics.
See the [Equations](../core/equations.qmd) page for the full zone definitions and mathematical formulation.

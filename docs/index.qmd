## What is ICOW.jl?

ICOW.jl is a Julia implementation of the "Island City on a Wedge" (iCOW) model from [Ceres et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03622-1).
It models flood risk management decisions for a stylized coastal city, including:

- **Withdrawal**: Relocating development from low-lying areas
- **Resistance**: Flood-proofing buildings
- **Protection**: Building dikes/seawalls

The model uses [SimOptDecisions.jl](https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/SimOptDecisions) for simulation-based optimization under uncertainty.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual simulation modes** | EAD (Expected Annual Damage) for fast deterministic analysis, or stochastic Monte Carlo |
| **Multi-objective optimization** | Find Pareto-optimal trade-offs between investment and damage |
| **SimOptDecisions integration** | Clean separation of physics, policies, and optimization |

## Installation

Requires Julia 1.10 or later.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/ICOW.jl")
```

## Quick Example

```julia
using ICOW
using Distributions

# Create a city with default parameters
city = CityParameters{Float64}()

# Define a protection strategy: 5m dike
policy = StaticPolicy(Levers(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0))

# Create forcing (50 years of GEV-distributed surges)
forcing = DistributionalForcing(
    [GeneralizedExtremeValue(1.0, 0.5, 0.1) for _ in 1:50], 1
)

# Run simulation
investment, damage = simulate(city, policy, forcing)
println("Investment: \$$(round(investment/1e9, digits=2))B")
println("Expected damage: \$$(round(damage/1e9, digits=2))B")
```

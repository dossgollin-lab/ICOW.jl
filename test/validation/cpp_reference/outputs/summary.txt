# ICOW C++ Reference Outputs (Debugged Version)
# Generated from debugged C++ code (icow_debugged.cpp)
#
# The original C++ has 7 documented bugs (see _background/equations.md).
# This harness fixes the 3 bugs that affect the tested functions:
# Bug Fix 1: Line 147 - Changed pow(..., 1/2) to sqrt(...)
# Bug Fix 2: Line 145 - Changed 2*dh*(ch+1/sd) to 2*ch*(ch+1/sd)
# Bug Fix 3: Line 35 - Changed CitySlope from CityLength/CityWidth to CityWidth/CityLength
#
# The remaining 4 bugs affect dike cost and damage calculations,
# which are not validated here (Julia uses corrected formulas from the paper).
# See _background/equations.md for full bug documentation.
